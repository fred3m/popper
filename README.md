#Popper

Interactive tile front end for iPython and Jupyter.

##Description

Popper, formerly [toyz](https://github.com/fred3m/toyz), is designed to connect to iPython kernels and display widgets created in a jupyter notebook or iPython console in a web browser or desktop application. Unlike the traditional Jupyter notebook format, Popper allows the user to display the widgets in resizeable tiles that can be organized in a single, or multiple windows, all connecting to the same ipython kernel.

The integration with toyz and Jupyter is currently under development. Check back in the coming months as this package is currently under rapid development.
